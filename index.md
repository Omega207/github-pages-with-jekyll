Hey! I'm Omega207 from GitHub.

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ... a History With GitHub: More in Depth.
I started GitHub after "leaving" Scratch, a online coding website. I left due to issues with the chat, hence why I don't use Discord and such. I decided to work on a website using the online program Wix, but I soon found that it didn't work for me. In 2022, I was finally on GitHub, hoping to learn all I can, while also developing software myself.
...That hasn't happened yet, but it will. Sooner or later.
