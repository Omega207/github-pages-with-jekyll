# HELP! Fangame Engine for Sonic Needed!
So, lately I've been having a brainstorm about a new Sonic the Hedgehog fangame. A few, actually. But I can't get a good one that actually works! 
I'm attempting to use the Sonic Infinity Engine Plus, but I cannot find a visible editor: it's also in .exe! 

---
I'm looking into it more and more, and hopefully I can find a good solution for it.

---
P.S. I _did_ find the original engine for Sonic Infinity, and it _does_ have a editor, but it is really slow (I'm using a laptop. Maybe that's the issue. 
But it is on Unreal Engine, and it _loves_ to compile shaders).
